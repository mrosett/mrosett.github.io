    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Last year, I wrote a piece called <a href="http://writing.maxrosett.com/thirty-books-before-thirty.html">“Thirty Books I Want to Read Before I Turn Thirty.”</a> The somewhat eclectic list actually consisted of twenty-four books, with empty slots left to add six more as the year went on. Roughly two-thirds of the books were well-known classics, while the remainder …</p>

        <p>James Scott’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-like-State-Certain-Condition/dp/0300078153">“Seeing Like a State”</a> is a fascinating account of how centralization schemes fail. The book’s title follows from a simple observation: centralized administrators need legibility to function. A state can’t collect taxes unless it knows who its citizens are and how much income they’re …</p>

        <p>The Vietnam War is foreign to me.  My father was far too young to be drafted, as he was in elementary school when the war ended. By the time I was that age, Vietnam had opened itself to foreign tourists. To my generation of Americans, Vietnam is an exotic vacation …</p>

        <p>This book convincingly demonstrates that we humans constantly deceive others and ourselves alike in the service of our own selfish motives. What's less clear is what implications follow from that.</p>
<p>The book is divided into two sections. The first lays out the immense array of ways in which humans are …</p>

        <p>I recently turned 29, and in honor of that milestone I've assembled a list of thirty books I'd like to read before I turn 30.</p>
