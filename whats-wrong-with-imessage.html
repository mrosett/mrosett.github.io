        <p>Apple's iMessage is a big part of iPhone's dominance over Android in the high end market. As others have pointed out, high-end Android phones can largely match the iPhone feature for feature, but the texting experience is a formaldehyde-preserved relic of the flip-phone era.</p>
<p>As an iPhone owner, I appreciate the near-seamless ability to switch my messaging between my phone and my Macbook. And no true millennial wants the green text bubble of shame that comes from leaving the Apple ecosystem.</p>
<p>So why has Apple let iMessage become a total disaster? At present, the macOS version and iOS version have at least three visible bugs. Two of these date back at least six months, while the other appeared after I started writing this article. While bugs that affect the iPhone are obviously more important, the ability to use the same messaging service across platforms is a big part of iMessage's appeal.</p>
<p>The most irritating bug causes messages to appear badly out of order. For whatever reason, iMessage occasionally decides to attach a random timestamp from the future to messages I send. This clumps my messages at the bottom, leaving it looking like I'm having a conversation with myself:</p>
<p><img alt="Out of Order iMessages" src="/images/out_of_order.png"></p>
<p>Side note: iMessage prefers to display this bug when I'm discussing private matters, which made getting a screenshot  a real hassle.</p>
<p>Another annoying bug attaches "not delivered" tags to messages I send from my laptop: </p>
<p><img alt="Not delivered iMessages" src="/images/not_delivered.png"></p>
<p>For a while, I found these tags concerning, but they happen so consistently that I just ignore them now. Still, my wife received a lot of duplicate messages from me before I figured out what was going on.</p>
<p>Finally, if I read a conversation on my desktop, it doesn't clear the unread message notification from my phone. This is the bug that was introduced after I started working on this post. (Admittedly, that was two months ago; I'm an engineer, not a journalist.) </p>
<p><img alt="Spurious iMessage Notifications" src="/images/out_of_order.png"></p>
<p>At the time I took this screenshot, I'd already seen all 16 of these messages on my laptop.</p>
<p>None of these bugs are backbreaking: I still use iMessage for 95% of my messaging. They also primarily affect users who try to use iMessage seamlessly across different Apple platforms. I have no idea what proportion of iMessage users fall into that category, although by definition we're Apple's highest spending customers.</p>
<p>Still, Apple is presumably paying a lot of very smart engineers to work on this product, and I'm genuinely baffled that these bugs were even introduced. This is a company that charges its customers a premium for polished products that just works. How have they let such obvious bugs persist for more than half a year?</p>
