        <p>We’re now well over half a year into the Covid-19 pandemic, and the lack of a vaccine is excruciating. With dozens of candidate vaccines generating countless headlines about positive results in early stage trials, it’s tempting to see any further delay as unnecessary. If we know that these …</p>

        <p>A common mistake that has become more common recently is treating graphs as indisputable facts. The truth is far messier: any data visualization is the product of numerous subjective decisions. An informed reader should be able to identify these decisions and understand their impact. Charts should be approached with the …</p>

        <p>The coronavirus pandemic is the first data-driven crisis. The key numbers – infections and deaths – are easily understood, widely available, and constantly changing.

        <p>Last year, I wrote a piece called <a href="http://writing.maxrosett.com/thirty-books-before-thirty.html">“Thirty Books I Want to Read Before I Turn Thirty.”</a> The somewhat eclectic list actually consisted of twenty-four books, with empty slots left to add six more as the year went on.

        <p>James Scott’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-like-State-Certain-Condition/dp/0300078153">“Seeing Like a State”</a> is a fascinating account of how centralization schemes fail.

A state can’t collect taxes unless it knows who its citizens are and how much income they’re …</p>

        <p>Ben Thompson's characteristically excellent <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-google-squeeze/">article</a> this week focuses on how Google has forced online travel agencies (like Expedia) to pay for traffic by prioritizing ads and pushing organic results further down the page.
