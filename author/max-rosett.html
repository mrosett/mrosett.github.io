        <p>Each winter morning, hordes of parka-clad addicts descend on the ski resorts that dot the mountains of the western US. They share one goal: allocating their time to maximize stoke levels at the moment they return to the lodge. The skiers employ a wide range of strategies to optimize these …</p>

        <p>The cryptocurrency ecosytem passed an interesting milestone in mid-November when the SEC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-264">settled charges</a> against two companies that had conducted ICOs. The SEC had previous taken action in connection with ICOs, but those were primarily textbook examples of fraud (guaranteed returns, founders absconding with proceeds, etc.) Those earlier enforcement actions …</p>

        <p>I recently turned 29, and in honor of that milestone I've assembled a list of thirty books I'd like to read before I turn 30.</p>
<p>From the end of high school until a few years ago, I undervalued books. I mostly consumed writing I found online. Online articles can be …</p>

        <p>Apple's iMessage is a big part of iPhone's dominance over Android in the high end market. As others have pointed out, high-end Android phones can largely match the iPhone feature for feature, but the texting experience is a formaldehyde-preserved relic of the flip-phone era.</p>
